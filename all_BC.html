    <h4>Traditional Brazilian food is delicious, colorful, diverse, and exciting. Because Brazil is such a melting pot of colors and customs, its cuisine varies from one region to another, reflecting the country’s diverse backgrounds and vast territory.</h4>
    <p>Brazilian food has been heavily influenced by the Portuguese colonization of the 16th century, by slaves brought from Africa, and by indigenous peoples, as well as other European, South American, and Asian countries. After slavery was abolished, Brazil recruited Europeans and Japanese immigrants to work in the coffee plantations – indeed today, Brazil is home to the world’s largest community of Japanese descendants outside of Japan, numbering about 1.6 million people.

        This influx of immigrants brought even more recipes and culinary influences to the table of traditional dishes. From the moment you arrive in the country, you’ll see that Brazilian recipes are prepared with love, and meals are more than simple meals – they’re an event. Here are 12 of the most famous Brazilian dishes you should try on your Brazil vacation if you get the chance.

        <section id="Picanha">
            <h2>Picanha</h2>
            <p>Barbecued meat is a Brazilian specialty. Picanha, a triangular cut of beef that comes from the rump cap muscle, is the most popular cut and it is seasoned with only salt before it’s cooked to perfection. The steaks are often bent in a horseshoe shape, skewered, and cooked over an open fire at the country’s churrascarias (restaurants that serve meat on huge sword-like skewers grilled over a wood fire). The thick layer of fat is charred and the tender, pink, smokey middle falls apart in your mouth. Picanha is one of the highlights you’ll find at a Brazilian barbecue.</p>

The traditional brigadeiro is milk chocolate, yet there are also white chocolate versions available, too. They are even more scrumptious when made with a whole strawberry in the center.
